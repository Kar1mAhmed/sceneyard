## 🎬 Demo Section — Production Notes

### **Current Implementation (Waitlist Page)**
- Videos are referenced but not included (placeholder paths)
- Download button opens modal: "Join Waitlist to Download"
- Modal redirects to waitlist signup

### **Production Implementation Required**

#### **1. Video Hosting**
- Host videos on CDN (Cloudflare R2, AWS S3)
- Generate multiple quality versions (4K, 1080p, 720p)
- Use signed URLs with expiration

#### **2. Download Flow**
```typescript
async function handleDownload(templateId: string) {
  // Generate idempotency key
  const idempotencyKey = `${userId}-${templateId}-${Date.now()}`;
  
  // Check user entitlement
  const hasAccess = await checkUserEntitlement(userId, templateId);
  
  if (!hasAccess) {
    showUpgradeModal();
    return;
  }
  
  // Generate signed download URL
  const signedUrl = await generateSignedDownloadUrl(
    templateId,
    userId,
    idempotencyKey
  );
  
  // Track download
  await trackDownload(templateId, userId, idempotencyKey);
  
  // Trigger download
  window.location.href = signedUrl;
}
```

#### **3. Idempotency**
- Client generates unique key per download attempt
- Server tracks attempts to prevent duplicate charges
- Store download history for analytics

#### **4. Entitlement Check**
- Verify user has sufficient credits
- Check subscription status
- Validate Golden Member benefits
