## 🔧 Next Step: Add LiquidEther Background

The LiquidEther component from reactbits.dev is too large to include in one file. Here's how to add it:

### Step 1: Install three.js (Already Done ✅)
```bash
npm install three
```

### Step 2: Create the LiquidEther Component

Create a new file: `components/LiquidEther.tsx`

Copy the EXACT code from this URL:
https://reactbits.dev/backgrounds/liquid-ether

**Or use the code I provided in the previous message** (it's the full implementation with all the WebGL shaders and fluid simulation).

### Step 3: Update page.tsx

Replace the background div in `app/page.tsx`:

**Current (line 13-14):**
```tsx
{/* Animated background - Simple gradient for now */}
<div className="fixed inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br from-[#0a0f1a] via-[#0f1420] to-[#0a0f1a]" style={{ zIndex: 0 }} />
```

**Replace with:**
```tsx
import LiquidEther from '@/components/LiquidEther';

// Then in the component:
<LiquidEther 
  colors={['#3b82f6', '#8b5cf6', '#06b6d4']}
  className="fixed inset-0"
  style={{ zIndex: 0 }}
  mouseForce={20}
  cursorSize={100}
  resolution={0.5}
  autoDemo={true}
  autoSpeed={0.5}
  autoIntensity={2.2}
/>
```
